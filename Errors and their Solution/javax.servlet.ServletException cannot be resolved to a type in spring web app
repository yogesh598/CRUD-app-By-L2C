Cause : Server may not configured successfully, this error usually happens whrn running the project for the first time.

Solution :
In Eclipse select your project → then click on project menu bar on top → goto to properties → 
click on Targeted Runtimes → now you must select a check box next to the server you are using to run current project → 
click Apply → then click OK button. That's it,
